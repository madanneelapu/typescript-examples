Execute the init command in project root directory. 
    tsc --init
TypeScript will create a configuration file called as 'tsconfig.json'

This configuration file allows us to configure various options using JSON properties.

Eg:
"noEmitOnError": true
Does not emit JS files if  there are errors in TS files
