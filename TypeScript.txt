TypeScript
----------

What is TypeScript?
A free and opensource programming language created and maintained by Microsoft.

Why TypeScript?
Problems with JavaScript:
- No type checking.
- No checking for function arguments.
- Cannot enforce the structure of objects. Objects are loosely structured in JavaScript.

Moreover, the Application complexity is increasing with everyday. 

Inspite of all these problems, why do we need JavaScript?
Thats because, browsers can understand only JavaScript.

How can we address this problem?
There is this Idea of Compilation, used in the case of High Level languages. What if we can write code in a language that has no weirdness as JavaScript, then use a compiler to convert it into JavaScript, then this compiled JavaScript is provided to Browser for execution.

This is Kind of possible with TypeScript.

Development Time------------------->RunTime-------------->
TypeScript -> TypeScript Compiler -> JavaScript -> Browser

TypeScript is Transpiled to JavaScript. Some people call it compilation.


What does TypeScript provide?
TypeScript -> JavaScript + types (and some other stuff)
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

It provides a way to use new features of JS without developers worrying about the compatability.

TypeScript makes building complex apps more manageable.

Frameworks like Angular are using TypeScript extensively.


Setting Up Dev Environment:
---------------------------
1. Install an editor like VSCode.
2. Install NodeJS.
3. Install TypeScript Compiler.
